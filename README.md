## 🛡️ Malicious URL Detection with Machine Learning 🚀

Dive into the world of safeguarding against online threats with cutting-edge machine learning techniques! This project delves deep into the realm of URL classification, distinguishing between benign URLs and those lurking with dangers like defacement, malicious intent, or malware.

### 🌟 Project Highlights

* **Model Exploration:** Embark on a journey through various machine learning models, from Random Forest and Decision Trees to AdaBoost and SGD Classifiers, uncovering the champion for accuracy and efficiency.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess model performance with precision using accuracy scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices, ensuring robust protection against diverse threats.
* **Flask Integration:** Seamlessly deploy the chosen model into a Flask application for lightning-fast URL analysis and real-time threat detection, empowering users to surf the web with confidence.

### 📊 Data Sources

Used the Malicious URLs dataset from kaggle

Features extracted from URLs may include:

* 📝 Lexical features (spotting suspicious keywords or unusual characters).
* 🌐 Host-based features (examining domain age, WHOIS info, or blacklisting status).
* 📃 Content-based features (analyzing website content for malicious elements).
